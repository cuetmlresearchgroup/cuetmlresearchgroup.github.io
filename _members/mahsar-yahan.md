Hi! I am a dedicated and enthusiastic Python developer with a strong interest in machine learning and deep learning. I've also had a long-standing interest in Natural Language Processing, which has been a significant area of my competence. My extensive knowledge of these subjects, as well as practical experience applying their concepts to a variety of projects, have driven my interest for them. I regard myself as a dedicated, punctual, and truthful individual that is always eager to learn and take on new challenges.
